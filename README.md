# Pipe Mania-Inspired JavaScript Canvas Game

## 🎮 Game Description

This game takes inspiration from the classic *Pipe Mania*. The objective is simple yet challenging: connect randomly generated pipe segments to create a continuous pipeline before time runs out. Once the timer ends, the liquid flows through your pipeline, and you score points based on its length and functionality.
